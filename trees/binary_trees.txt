Trees: Unlike Arrays, Linked Lists, Stack and queues, which are linear data structures, trees are hierarchical data structures.
Tree Vocabulary: The topmost node is called root of the tree. The elements that are directly under an element are called its children. 
The element directly above something is called its parent.
For example, ‘a’ is a child of ‘f’, and ‘f’ is the parent of ‘a’. Finally, elements with no children are called leaves. 

Every parent node in a binary tree has max 2 child nodes.

      tree
      ----
       j    <-- root
     /   \
    f      k  
  /   \      \
 a     h      z    <-- leaves
 
 
 binary search trees:
 nodes are organized in a certain order such that all nodes to left of root are less than root and all nodes to right of root are greater than root
       binary search tree
      ----
       10    <-- root
     /   \
    5      20  
  /   \      \
 1     6      25    <-- leaves
 
 
 Main applications of trees include: 
1. Manipulate hierarchical data. 
2. Make information easy to search (see tree traversal). 
3. Manipulate sorted lists of data. 
4. As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects. 
5. Router algorithms 
6. Form of a multi-stage decision-making (see business chess).
