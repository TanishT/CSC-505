parts of a recurse program

base case:
    The base case returns a value without making any subsequent recursive calls. 
    It does this for one or more special input values for which the function can be evaluated without recursion. 
reduction:
    The reduction step is the central part of a recursive function. 
    It relates the value of the function at one (or more) input values to the value of the function at one (or more) other input values. 
    Furthermore, the sequence of input values values must converge to the base case. 
    For factorial(), the value of n decreases by 1 for each call, so the sequence of input values converges to the base case.
