a) Given the Link class above, write some Java code that creates ...
 - a Link containing the value "Apple"
 - a Link containing the value "Banana"
 - a Link containing the value "Jackfruit"

The next for each of these Links should be null initially.

b) Write java code that orders the three Links in alphabetical order

c) Finally, write code that would remove the middle link (the Link containing Banana in this case) leaving Apple -> Jackfruit

d) Try to repeat the above using only a single Link variable
