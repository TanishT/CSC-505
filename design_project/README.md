## User Guide for Tanish Tyagi Design Project

## What is included in the project?
The purpose of my project was to learn all about graphs and apply them to competitive programming problems. As part of this project, I created note files that talk about the different types of graphs and important properties. These files can be found in graphs/notes/docs. I have also included of different graphs as I am a visual learner. These files can be found in graphs/notes/assets. I also wrote code that can check for important graph properties such as Bipartiteness, connectivity, cyles, etc. These files can be found in graphs/notes/properties. There is also code for different graph algorithsm I researched, such as DFS, BFS,and Floodfill. These can be found in graphs/notes/algos. Finally, I have solved 6 graph realted problems from competitive programming sites such as Codeforces, CSES, and USACO. 

## Important Information

All the code files in graphs/notes are not intended to be run, as I refer to those files only for reference. Some of them may not be compilable. All the code files in graph/problems can and are intended to be ran.

## Steps for Running Code
1. Download and extract zip folder in a desired file location
2. Navigate to graphs/problems/(which is the location of all solution files)
3. Run desired files
    - For C++ files, make sure that you have a g++ compiler set up
        - run g++ filename.cpp (replace filename with actual file name)
        - run a.exe (you should recieve some output which is the answer for the sample case for each problem)
    - For Java files, make sure taht you have a java environment set up
        - run java filename.java (replace filename with actual filename)
