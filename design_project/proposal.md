# Design Project Proposal - Tanish Tyagi

I am interested in exploring different methods of storing data in a graph (adjacency list, adjcency matrix). In addition, I think it is important to understand how these storage methods can be used to solve relevant Computer Science problems.

Steps of my project:
1. Review different methods of traversing a graph (DFS/BFS).
2. Understand different methods of storing data in a graph. I will understand the pros and cons of all storage methods and implement them in code.
