# Design Project Proposal - Tanish Tyagi

I am interested in exploring different methods of storing data in a graph (adjacency list, adjcency matrix). In addition, I think it is important to understand how these storage methods can be used to solve relevant Computer Science problems.

Steps of my project:
1. Review different methods of traversing a graph (DFS/BFS).
2. Understand different methods of storing data in a graph. I will understand the pros and cons of all storage methods and implement them in code.
3. Learn and understand the graph properties below:
   - Connectivity
   - Weights
   - Directed and Undirected
   - Neighbors and Degrees
   - Colorings <br>
I will also understand how to write code that checks for these properties in a graph.
4. Learn, understand, and implement the following graph algorithms:
   - Floodfill
   - Functional Graphs
5. Apply these algorithms to the following USACO problems:
    - http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=895 (Floodfill)
    - http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=570 (FloodFill)
    - http://www.usaco.org/index.php?page=viewproblem2&cpid=764 (Functional Graphs)
